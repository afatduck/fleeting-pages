## Description

Fleeting Pages is intended as a custom new page tab. User can add their websites and they will fly around the screen. To visit the website, user can click on the website and it will open. However, the websites will do their best to avoid the user's cursor.

## Reccomended Setup (Windows)

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Python if not already installed, no dependencies are required
3. Set up a task scheduler to run the server.py script on startup, or just run the script manually, the website will be on port 8383
4. Set up your browser to open the website on new tab, some browsers may require an extension for this
5. Enjoy!

## Background images

You can change the background images by just adding or deleting images in the `image` folder. The images will be randomly selected each time the page is loaded.
