# Fleeting Pages

## Description

Fleeting Pages is intended as a custom new page tab. User can add their websites and they will fly around the screen. To visit the website, user can click on the website and it will open. However, the websites will do their best to avoid the user's cursor.

## Local Setup (Windows)

Benefits of setting up locally, images will load faster and you have access to the images folder.

1. Clone (download) the repository and extract it.
2. Install Python if not already installed, no dependencies are required.
3. In the website folder, you will find a `run.vbs` file, create a shortcut to this file.
4. Press `Win + R` and type `shell:startup`, this will open the startup folder, place the shortcut in this folder. Now the website will start on startup, to start it right away, double click vbs file.
5. Set up your browser to open the website on new tab, some browsers may require an extension for this, link to the website is `http://127.0.0.1:8383/`.
6. Enjoy!

I trust Linux users can figure this out by themselves, and Mac users are irrelevant.

## Online Setup

All you need to do is set the new tab page to the website. The website is hosted on [http://104.196.233.141/](http://104.196.233.141/).
I wouldn't purchase a domain for this, as it is just a fun project. Some browers might complain about the website not being secure, but it is just a new tab page.

## Background images

You can change the background images by just adding or deleting images in the `image` folder. The images will be randomly selected each time the page is loaded.
