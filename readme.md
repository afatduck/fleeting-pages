# Fleeting Pages

## Description

Fleeting Pages is intended as a custom new page tab. User can add their websites and they will fly around the screen. To visit the website, user can click on the website and it will open. However, the websites will do their best to avoid the user's cursor.

## Local Setup (Windows)

Benefits of setting up locally, images will load faster and you have access to the images folder.

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Python if not already installed, no dependencies are required
3. Set up a task scheduler to run the server.py script on startup, or just run the script manually, the website will be on port 8383
4. Set up your browser to open the website on new tab, some browsers may require an extension for this
5. Enjoy!

## Online Setup

All you need to do is set the new tab page to the website. The website is hosted on [http://104.196.233.141/](http://104.196.233.141/).
I wouldn't purchase a domain for this, as it is just a fun project. Some browers might complain about the website not being secure, but it is just a new tab page.

## Background images

You can change the background images by just adding or deleting images in the `image` folder. The images will be randomly selected each time the page is loaded.
